# Catastrophy
 -- The boot is on the other paw --

This is a game we created for Ludum Dare 43.  The theme of the competition was
`Sacrifices must be made`.

## Game premise
The main character is a cat, exploring the house finding things to do.  During
sleep times, the cat visits the shadow realm and comes face to face with the cat
god (a ball of wool).  Sacrificing tokens the cat gains from day-to-day life,
causes the god to provide powers to the cat, for even more hijicks.
